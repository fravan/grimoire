# Grimoire


## POC phase
TODO:
- Allow editing of entity's details.
- \[Bonus\] add auto selection range and stuff when cursor moves in textarea to simplify editing.
- End of POC?

## MVP phase
TODO:
- Architecture, database, entities and stuff. How to configure? Agnostic to specific games, so no rules but lots of configuration.
- Stuff to think about:
  - Characters
  - Quests
  - Locations
  - Items
  - Items that are consumables
  - Glossary entries (not visible in main page but can be linked to?)
  - Combat (as in helping GM when combat starts, not a combat encounter builder)
- If full configuration route, add templates for easier init phase
- Test with my own campaign and see if it's worth somethingâ€¦
